# PhoneLocality-
Find out the local area of a phone number you enter, i am wanting to intergrate with an API to link Sasktel cell phone towers to get information on where a cell phone may be located by city


## Uses OpenCage API##

This is a work in progress, this is my first script i have even written, I would like to extend an invitation to somebody who can help me get cell tower data by cel phone number to trace cell phone by city location
